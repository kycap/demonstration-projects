# Demonstration Projects
## Evaluation of CWPPRA demonstration projects

The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) allocates funds for projects along the Louisiana coast. There are a variety of project types, including marsh creation, shoreline protection, and hydrologic restoration. Demonstration Projects are another, though they are rarely nominated and funded. 

They have the potential to show promising new techniques to make more effective future projects. This was an exercise to scrape a table from a website, filter the table to only show demonstration projects, and graph each project cost versus year (with points colored by agency) and also to make a histogram binning the projects by cost.
